## Prerequisites
If you'd like to make a change or edit this site, feel free to submit a PR. To get started, you'll need:

+ Node.js (latest LTS recommended)(and get it from [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
+ get a fork or clone this repo 
+ in the project directory, run `npm install`
+ and finally run `npm run dev`


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
